# Neural network-based region reaching formation control in an obstacle environment
This MATLAB program is done as a verification of the main results that are shown in the work "Yu, Jinwei, et al. "Neural network-based region reaching formation control for multi-robot systems in obstacle environment." Neurocomputing 333 (2019): 11-21.".

The studied problem is formation control in an obstacle environment. The main task to be solved is to achieve a collision-avoiding, obstacle-avoiding, region-reaching formation of a multiagent system considering the existence of bounded disturbances and uncertainty in the agents’ models.

The proposed solution uses a combination of different tools which are:

•	Potential functions to achieve the region reaching and obstacle and collision avoidance.

•	RBF neural network to learn the unknown dynamic of the agents.

•	Robust compensator to eliminate the effect of uncertainties and external disturbances.

•	 Adaptive control gains with dynamic adaptation laws to adjust the weight of the control task.
